# IndividualProject - Joseph M. Cameron
## Using Machine Learning to Understand Knot Topology
This repository contains the code, log, meeting minutes and status reports for my individual dissertation project, which was undertaken during my 4th year at the University of Glasgow.

This project's aim is to classify knots based on their topology.

Knot classification is achieved by a convolutional neural network implemented in Keras.
The convolutional neural network is located within the python script knotClassifier.py located in the KnotClassifier folder.
In total, this software provides the capability to classify ten knots, with the ten knots being:
* The Alpine Butterfly Knot
* The Bowline Knot
* The Clove Hitch
* The Figure-8 Knot
* The Figure-8 Loop
* The Fisherman's Knot
* The Flemish Bend
* The Overhand Knot
* The Reef Knot
* The Slip Knot

A controlled dataset, containing images of these ten knots in differing conditions is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/josephcameron/10knots
