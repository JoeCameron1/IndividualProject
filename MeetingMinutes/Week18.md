# Week 18 Meeting Minutes - 22/02/2018

The meeting began with an overview of my progress over the past week.
This week, I managed to add some more content to my Background & Scope chapter.
John asked me what my plan was for the upcoming weeks regarding the dissertation.
My plan is to finish a draft of the Background (& Scope), Design and Implementation chapters by March 1st.
John said this is sensible.
John also added some tips for the dissertation.
He stated that I should absolutely ensure that my Background chapter is a coherent argument, where everything has a purpose for being included.

Furthermore, I became far more familiar with Google Colaboratory this week, however, I ran into a problem.
The problem was that I could not upload folders to the VM.
John then suggested that I perhaps upload a zip file instead.
I agreed that this may be a sensible solution, and I plan to try this soon.

For the rest of the meeting, we further discussed plans for the Evaluation.
John suggested that I consider making a small neural network, with around 100,000-200,000 training parameters, in order to effectively test how the model architecture affects performance.
Also, we both agreed that the Evaluation is not about showing that things work, but rather attempting to explain and show how the performance is affected in various situations.
