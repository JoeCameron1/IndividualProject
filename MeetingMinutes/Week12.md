# Week 12 Meeting Minutes - 11/01/2018

The meeting started with an overview of my progress over the Christmas break.
First, I told John that I had managed to collect data of my new 5 additional knots for my controlled datasets on both a reflective background and a non-reflective background.
John was very happy to hear this and then asked me about my progress with the Blender dataset.
I confessed that the Blender dataset is taking much more time and effort than expected, however, I am getting close to hopefully finishing it.
Furthermore, I explained that I also managed to gain some uncontrolled/'in the wild' data on the new five knots, so in theory, I have hopefully finished taking photos of all the knots with my camera.

Overall, I also conveyed that I had taken the time during the Christmas break to recharge for the upcoming semester, and John agreed that this was a senesible decision.
John then asked for my plan over the next few weeks to begin the second semester of this project effectively.
I relayed that I plan to extend the neural network models to now classify ten knots instead of five.
I also hope to become familiar with data visualisation techniques such as t-SNE, so I can begin to understand what's truly happening in my experiments and draw conclusions.
Finally, I also stated that I hope to publish my datasets on Kaggle once they are complete.
