# Week 1 Meeting Minutes - 28/09/2017

First, it was established that meetings would occur at 9:30am on a weekly basis. 

Next, details of project management were discussed. 
It was made clear that a short status report of my progree must be created before every weekly meeting.
We decided that I should email this status report to John every Wednesday night before the meeting on Thursday morning. 
I must also keep a log of project work, noting the date, hours and a short summary of work achieved.
The use of version control was brought up by John, where I immediately stated that I would manage a git repository for the project.
John then reccommended that I use Zotero for managing references, and that I look up academic papers on ArxivSanityPreserver.

To wrap up the meeting, we discussed what the goals of week 1 are. 
John sent me an email comprised of useful books and blogs on machine learning, which I should start reading over the course of week 1.
John also reccommended that I look up convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks and autoencoders.
Next, we discussed whether there are any existing datasets consisting of knot images?
Over the course of week 1 I should look for this and start thinking about how I would go about making my own dataset.
It was then established that the final goal of week 1 would involve deep learning frameworks, and making a choice of which one to use with a justification.
