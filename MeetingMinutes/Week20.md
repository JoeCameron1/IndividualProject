# Week 20 Meeting Minutes - 08/03/2018

The meeting mainly consisted of a review of my dissertation so far.
Considering the Introduction chapter, John suggested that I add a scope section to the end of the Introduction chapter, where I can formally explain the scope and requirements of the project.

Next, considering the Background chapter, John reccommended that I move the Machine Learning related background to the beginning of the chapter.
The reason for this is to explain project-specific background first.
Also, the background chapter should contain references to textbooks (in the case of basic things such as supervised learning etc...) or papers (in the case of dropout etc...).
Also, the Machine Learning Techniques subsection is the perfect place to mention background on Dropout etc... from specific papers.

With regard to the Design chapter, I must be careful about not including specific implementation details.
For example, I should only mention the Gaussian Noise layer in the Implementation chapter.
The same principle applies to my mention of CoreML in the iOS app subsection.
For the iOS app subsection, I should mention the high-level design (functionality etc...) over specific implementation details.

Concerning the Implementation chapter, the structure was good.
Although I should certainly add more figures to the code snippets, the figures made from plot_model in Keras for example.

Next, I mentioned that I am looking to plan my Evaluation chapter today.
John stressed that each subsection of the Evaluation chapter should answer one specific question from the scope subsection in the Introduction chapter.

Overall, John also suggested that I make sure I use a consistent voice throughout the dissertation, instead of using many as I currently do.
Also, it is important to check that each section has the same level of abstraction.
If it does not, that is a good sign that it should be split up into more subsections.
