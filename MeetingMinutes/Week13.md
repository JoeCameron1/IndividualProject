# Week 13 Meeting Minutes - 18/01/2018

The meeting started with a quick overview of my progress throughout the last week.
John was happy to see that two more of my controlled datasets had been uploaded to my repository.
Next, John then suggested that I should leave the Blender dataset for at least the next couple of weeks, as it has become very time-consuming to model the knots.
Later, after the core machine learning aspects of this project are complete, the Blender dataset is certainly something I am willing to explore further, as it would be extremely useful to instantly generate a large volume of training data.

The rest of the meeting focused on the machine learning aspects of the project.
John mentioned that I should get a multi-output CNN (with the extra tension variable) working by the end of this week and I fully agreed.
Next, I mentioned that I would also like to at least create a working GAN which simply synthesises images by the end of the week.
John then suggested that I first implement a known/working version of a GAN, as they can be notoriously difficult to train etc.

The meeting ended with myself asking John a question regarding my datasets.
I asked whether I could upload my training images downloaded from the internet to my repository.
John suggested that it would be best to only upload datasets I have created, and to simply utilise the images downloaded from the internet.
I then suggested that in my spare time, I would discover the possibility of integrating the Keras models with an iOS application and John seemed very happy for me to explore this further.

Overall, my goals for the end of next week are to have implemented a fully functioning multi-output CNN and a basic GAN which synthesises images.
