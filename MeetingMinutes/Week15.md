# Week 15 Meeting Minutes - 01/02/2018

The meeting began with a quick overview of my progress over the past week.
John was happy to hear that I combatted the issue of overfitting in my model.
However, he also suggested that this week, I should focus on performing my model analysis on different training and validation sets where the training and validation data is completely separate.
This would show whether the model is truly generalising or not.
Currently, it is difficult to make this claim, as my training and validation datasets are reasonably similar.

John was also happy to see that I had produced some form of t-SNE graph, but advised that I should now make sure the t-SNE is working correctly by using it to visualise MNIST data for example.

Next, the meeting focused on the strategic plan for the future until the hand-in date.
Firstly, in the scope of this week, I stated that I would like to carry out the classification experiments and t-SNE experiments as advised by John at the beginning of the meeting.
I also stated that I would like to push on with making a tension classification CNN and perhaps a GAN architecture that is suited to synthesising images of knots at different tensions.
Finally, I stated that I would also like to write a first draft of the entire introduction for the dissertation.

John agreed with my judgement, and then gave more advice about the dissertation in particular.
John explained and reinforced the key purposes of the dissertation so I can start to write correctly.
For example, I should explain my thought process/decision making throughout the project in the dissertation and show that I have been able to develop a project with scope out of a topic.
Although, it is important for me to not write a tutorial, I could write a blog-post to achieve that.
The key of the dissertation is to show mastery of the subject and my process of carrying out the project.
Within the dissertation, I should show critical evaluation and explain my decisions throughout the project.
However, with that in mind, I definitely want to show what factors lead to good classifier and explain some concepts in a tutorial-like manner to show my understanding of the techniques I have employed in the project.
