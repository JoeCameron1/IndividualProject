# Week 2 Meeting Minutes

Following from the last meeting, John and I first discussed what I had summarised in the Week 1 status report.
I downloaded Zotero and relayed how useful it has been for managing references.
I also decided to use Keras as the deep learning framework for the project.
I gave the justification that Keras can use Tensorflow as a back-end (where Keras is the front-end API), meaning that the models are portable across multiple devices.
One possibility of this project is to make a mobile application, this is something that Tensorflow can better handle over rivals such as Torch and Caffe. 
Also, Keras and Tensorflow have far superior documentation when compared to frameworks such as Torch and Caffe.
Alongside all this, Keras allows for the capability of fast implementation, whiich is key to this project. 
This is the advantage of Keras over Tensorflow.
John thought that these justifications and the decision to use Keras were very sensible, and added that Keras is certainly the best choice as I am new to machine learning.

Next, I asked John a few questions.
First, I asked whether I should add my status reports and project log to my git repository?
John replied, stating that this is a good idea, and that it is good to keep the project log, status reports and even meeting minutes on the repository for good orginisation.
Secondly, I asked John for more details on Autoencoders and GANs.
John conveyed that the purpose of an autoencoder is to learn a representation for a set of data, and that GANs have been successful at constructing 3d objects from images.
John also stated that it is more important to focus on CNNs and knot classification in these initial stages of the project.
Lastly, I asked how many knots I should aim to classify initially?
John stated that it is essential to first take baby steps, and start out classifying a handful of basic knots at most.

During the latter stages of the meeting, we discussed the aims and goals of week 2.
The goals of week 2 are to be very focused on the construction and management of my knots dataset and installing/using Keras for th first time.
Immediately, John suggested that I look up the procedure of data augmentation, as this is an essential component to using my own dataset effectively.
John then suggested that I complete an MNIST digit recognition tutorial in order to get a feel for classification techniques within Keras.
