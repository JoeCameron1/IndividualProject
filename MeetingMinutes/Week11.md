# Week 11 Meeting Minutes

The meeting started with a review of last week's progress.
John was happy to hear that I had expanded all my datasets, and reccommended that I continue doing so until Christmas.
John was also very happy to hear that I had managed to download Blender and experiment with automating 3D knot data collection through python scripts.
We both agreed that it would be extremely valuable to simulate photography (camera position, lighting etc.) in Blender.
My continuation with this automation in Blender will be one of my main goals to accomplish before Christmas.

John also commented on my selection of 5 further knots to classify.
I then asked a question regarding the my choice of including the Clove Hitch.
My concern is that there may be some bias in the classification if the Clove Hitches are the only images that contain foreign objects (other than rope).
John agreed, and suggested that I should either include more hitch knots or only attach the hitches to other pieces of rope.
I relayed that it may be best to only attach the hitch to rope, as this would allow me to produce narrow my focus with the dataset.
This could also provide interesting insight into whether the classifier can classify the hitch attached to various objects.
If not, there could be interesting further work regarding the classification of hitches.

The meeting then concluded with a discussion on what my plans for the second semester are.
I initially indicated that I am very interested in working with GANs to reproduce knots of different tensions or different materials.
John agreed that this would be very interesting and cool, although he also suggested that I could focus on recovering the knot topology using a mathematical construct.
For example, I could give every knot mathematical notation, and then along with images, the GAN could also output the mathematical notation, thus indicating its recovery of knot topology.
We both agreed that I should focus on gathering/finishing my dataset collection before Christmas and write the dissertaion/focus on GANs next semester.
