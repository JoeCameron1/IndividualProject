# Week 4 Meeting Minutes - 19/10/2017

First, we discussed my progress over the previous week. 
I first stated that I had set-up my git repository and that it will also be hosted on GitHub as a private repository.
Then, I proposed that John should be a watcher of the repo, to keep an eye on my commits/progress beyond the status reports.
John agreed to this, and I added John as a watcher of my repo.
Next, we discussed my progress with the data augmentation tutorial.
I relayed that the tutorial went smoothly, and that I could now understand the ways in which Keras can manipulate data.
Furthermore, we then talked about the variables I had identified for my initial dataset.
John stated that with this dataset, it is important to find the important variables and see how those variables affect the classification results.
For example, does image brightness greatly affect classification accuracy? 
This type of analysis leads to a deeper understanding of how to further compose a bigger and more diverse dataset.
John also mentioned that within the Analysis section of my dissertation, it would also be important to justify the need for my own dataset, by comparing the ImagNet images and my images and what variables affected/didn't affect the classifier.
It is important to show scientific thoroughness in this section of the dissertation.
John also mentioned that it is important to find where the system breaks, and perhaps mention this in the further work section of the dissertation.
This discussion over the dissertation itself, prompted me to ask questions about the dissertation itself and its structure.
We decided to make the dissertation structure plan one goal over the next week.
I asked John about writing the dissertation this early, and John answered that it is wise to start writing early, as this allows time for him to thoroughly read and give feedback.

We also discussed when I should start gathering data for the initial dataset.
I suggested that I should have gathered all initial data over the next two weeks, and that over the next week I should put together a plan, separating the invariant variables and the variables which may affect classification.
John stated that this is sensible and ended the meeting.
