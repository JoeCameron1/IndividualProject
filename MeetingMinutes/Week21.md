# Week 21 Meeting Minutes - 15/03/2018

I began the meeting by asking John a question concerning the structure of my project requirements and scope.
I was a bit confused about the positioning of laying out my specific questions.
John suggested that I lay out a high-level overview of the project requirements in the introduction and then begin to propose specific questions such as 'Does data augmentation alleviate overfitting?' in the evaluation chapter.

Next, I explained that the dissertation page limit is fast being approached while just explaining the task of classification alone, without generation.
At this point, we both agreed that it is sensible to only scratch the surface of this topic and mainly explore it within the future section of the conclusion chapter.
This is mainly due to time constraints, as a GAN implementation can involve the resources of another project on its own.

Finally, we agreed to move weekly meetings to Tuesday at 10am, in order to fit in an extra meeting to review the dissertation before the dissertation deadline.
