# Week 1 Status Report

In the past week, following on from our meeting, I have gathered background knowledge on machine learning via the resources you provided. 
I also spent time learning the various types of neural networks, in particular Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). 
GANs could prove very useful in 3D visualisation of knot topology. 

I have experimented with various deep learning frameworks such as Keras, Tensorflow, Caffe and PyTorch. 
As a result, I have chosen to implement my neural networks in Keras, with appropriate justification. 

I have also looked for datasets containing images of knots. 
While I have found one or two appropriate data sets, I would like to create my own data sets in order to prevent possible overfitting, and to train/test the networks on many generalised data sources. 

For organising references and managing a bibliography throughout the project, I have downloaded Zotero and become familiar with Arxiv Sanity Preserver.
