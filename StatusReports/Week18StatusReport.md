# Week 18 Status Report

This week I have been mainly focusing on writing more content for the dissertation. 
I have written drafts for the majority of the Background & Scope chapter and the Dataset Design section of the Design chapter. 
I have uploaded the text from the dissertation so far on Overleaf https://www.overleaf.com/read/fqtphjydxbqz . 
However, this is without figures because Overleaf began to complain about the file sizes, so I will have to fix this as soon as possible.

Aside from the dissertation, I finally managed to submit my code for generating confusion matrices onto the repository. 
Unfortunately, I still could not upload my dataset to Google Colab because it would occasionally fail to connect to Google servers almost everyday, leading to a long and laborious debugging process. 
Nevertheless, I am quite stubborn with this and will continue to try and make it work, as I see GPU training adding great value to the GAN implementation. 
Meanwhile, I trained my large CNN on a CPU for 1000 epochs, and saw a slight improvement to approximately 70% validation accuracy, with some signs of overfitting due to a gap appearing between the training accuracy and validation accuracy.
