# Week 12 Status Report

This week started with me getting myself back into the swing of things after the Christmas break. 

Firstly, I prepared my datasets (my controlled datasets) to be committed to my repository and I have now committed an extra two datasets to my repository. 
These two committed datasets are the original five knots with a non-reflective background dataset and the new five knots with a reflective background dataset. 
Soon, I will also commit the final controlled dataset, which is the new five knots with a non-reflective background dataset. 
After this, I will have completed my controlled datasets from which I can classify ten individual knots.

Secondly, I resumed my work with the Blender knots dataset. 
Over the Christmas break, I briefly became familiar with writing scripts in Blender to move the camera around many angles of an object. 
This week, I decided to begin drawing each knot in Blender, either with a script or by hand in the Blender GUI. 
However, I quickly realised that making 3D models of complicated knots such as the Figure-8 loop etc. in Blender may become extremely time consuming and detract from the machine learning aspects of this project, as it took me approximately 7 hours to create the reasonably simple Overhand and Reef knots. 
As a result, I began looking for alternative ways of gaining more data through 3D modelling and I came across programs such as KnotPlot to make the 3D models. 
There is also a website dedicated to 3D knot animations (that displays multiple angles of many knots) that I am considering taking photos from.
