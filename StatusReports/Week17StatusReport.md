# Week 17 Status Report

This week, I focused on two objectives. 

Firstly, I managed to write more content on deep learning specifically for the Background & Scope section of my dissertation and add some more useful figures.

Secondly, I experimented with Google Colaboratory in order to train my CNN on a GPU. 
The only difficulty I am currently encountering with this involves uploading the data. 
Currently, I have my repository on my Google Drive, however, Google Colaboratory seeks file upload, meaning I cannot easily upload my images to the VM where I can train via a GPU. 
Iâ€™m hoping to quickly find a solution to this through using the Google FUSE API.
