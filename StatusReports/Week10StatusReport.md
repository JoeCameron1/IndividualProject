# Week 10 Status Report

This week, I have managed to expand many of my datasets. 
Firstly, I have managed to double my wild dataset through downloading pictures from Flickr. 
I have also started creating a new ‘wild’ dataset of my own pictures (not downloaded from the internet). 
My own wild dataset includes images of knots tied using ribbon, twine, garden rope, elastic etc; there is a variety of material used that I managed to source over the weekend. 
So far, this dataset contains approximately 150 images. 

I have also started a controlled dataset similar to my first dataset containing images of the next five knots I will add to the classifier. 
These five knots will be the Figure-8 Loop, the Clove Hitch knot, the Figure-8 knot, the Flemish Bend Knot and the Slip Knot.

Furthermore, I have managed to become familiar with Blender and completed the tutorial sent last week. 
I am currently experimenting with python scripts to automate the creation of 3D knots I wish to classify using the Blender API. 
Once this starts working, I will be able to create a large volume of data.
