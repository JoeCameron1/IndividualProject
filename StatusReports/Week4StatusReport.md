# Week 4 Status Report

This week, one of my main goals was to select five particular knots and get familiar with tying and grouping them. 
The five initial knots I want to classify are the Fisherman’s Knot, the Mountaineer’s Coil, the Noose, the Reef Knot and the Alpine Butterfly Knot. 
As this project heavily features various knots, I found it important to gain familiarity with these knots this week. The knots mentioned will be the first 5 knots I aim to classify.

With regard to datasets, I explored various ways to organise machine learning datasets and augment it with the help of Francois Chollet’s Data Augmentation tutorial on the Keras Blog: https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html. 
The code from this tutorial is now on my GitHub repository. 
With this further understanding, I now understand how to organise and scale my personal dataset. 
Furthermore, I now have some climbing rope, which I have been tying knots with, and I have started to compose a dataset. 
It will take some time to develop a reasonably large/diverse dataset to combat the issue of overfitting, but I plan to spend the next week on this.

Concerning variables within my dataset, I have also decided to add the image contrast to my list of testing variables, as it would be interesting to observe whether contrast helps or hinders classification. 

Another primary goal for the past week was to come up with an initial structure for my dissertation. I’ve identified an initial structure as follows: 

Abstract
Introduction including motivation and research questions/literature review
Background and Related Work
Knot Classification
Implementation in Keras
Evaluation
Conclusion including Future Work
Appendices
Bibliography 

Of course, this structure will change, and chapters will be added, such as possible mobile implementations and GANs etc. but this is an initial idea for dissertation structure. 
Over the next week, I plan to type up an initial draft for the motivation and project aims/research questions.
