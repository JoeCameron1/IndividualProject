# Week 19 Status Report

This week I have been primarily writing my dissertation due to the upcoming deadline in two weeks. 
I have expanded both the Design and Implementation chapters with text and figures. 
My current dissertation is too big to attach, therefore I will bring it with me to our weekly meeting via USB stick.

In terms of implementation, I have committed a script that enables augmented images to be saved after data augmentation. 
This is a handy tool for the dissertation, and enabled me to update my data augmentation by adding a few extra features and removing others.
