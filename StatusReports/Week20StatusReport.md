# Week 20 Status Report

This week, I focused heavily on the dissertation and the planning of the evaluation chapter in particular. 
Concerning the evaluation chapter, I have come up with a set of experiments to answer questions and requirements I have laid out in my newly added scope and requirements section in the Introduction chapter. 
Although mainly, I have expanded text in the Introduction, Background and Implementation chapters. 
I will bring my current dissertation on my laptop to this weekâ€™s meeting.

With regard to the implementation, I have added additional command-line flags with the argparse library to achieve the results for my planned evaluation experiments from one single script.
