# Week 16 Status Report

This week, I initially focused on improving my CNN performance. 
I immediately set the training data augmentation rotation range to 360 (from 1), meaning the data is now rotating as it should have been all along. 
This change already resulted in noticeably less overfitting. 
Then, I focused on tweaking various parameters in the model, for example, I switched from the RMS prop optimiser function to the Adam optimiser function to gain a more consistent validation accuracy. 
All of these small changes were committed to the repo. 
Next, I focused on expanding my model architecture to include more convolutional layers. 
I did this but saw no improvement.

For the rest of the week, I focused on writing and structuring parts of the background chapter in my dissertation. 
My dissertation is attached for review.
