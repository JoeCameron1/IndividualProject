# Week 11 Status Report

This week, I have managed to continue making good progress with expanding my datasets. 
Firstly, I have continued adding photos to my ‘wild’ dataset of images downloaded from the internet. 
This dataset now contains approximately 175 images. 
Secondly, I have finished gathering data for my dataset containing images of the next five knots I proposed to classify, meaning I should now be capable of classifying ten different knots. 
Over the Christmas holiday period, I will spend some time performing experimentation on 10-knot classification. 
Lastly, I have made good progress with my Blender data-collection script. 
Although I am not yet satisfied with its automation, I intend to commit this script to the project repo at some point over the Christmas holiday once it is fully optimised.

On another note, I have managed to make progress with t-SNE visualisation this week. 
I found the t-SNE paper by Geoffrey Hinton and Laurens van der Maaten and have researched the area. 
I am now in the process of experimenting with the visualisation in my own classification.

I’m pleased to say that the dataset collection should be entirely finished before Christmas once I spend the next week optimising all my scripts. 
After this, I will spend some time during the Christmas holiday expanding my CNN model (multi-output) and writing the dissertation.
